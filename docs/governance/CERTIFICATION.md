## 1. What Is Certification

NL Protocol Certification is a third-party verification that an implementation -- whether it is an agent framework, a platform integration, an SDK, or a secret manager -- conforms to the NL Protocol specification at a defined level.

Certification means that an independent review has confirmed:

- The implementation satisfies all MUST and REQUIRED provisions for the claimed conformance level.
- The implementation passes the automated conformance test suite for that level.
- The implementation's architecture is consistent with the security guarantees of the NL Protocol.

Certification is not a rubber stamp. It is a technical evaluation that gives your users confidence that your product actually delivers on the promise of the NL Protocol: **secrets never enter the LLM context**.

---

## 2. Certification Levels

Certification levels correspond directly to the NL Protocol conformance levels.

### Basic Certification

**Specification coverage:** Levels 1-3 (Agent Identity, Action-Based Access, Execution Isolation)

**What it proves:**
- Agents interacting with your implementation are authenticated via verifiable identity documents.
- Agents request actions, not secrets. Your implementation resolves credentials internally.
- Actions execute in environments isolated from the agent's LLM context.
- Secrets never appear in action results returned to the agent.

**Suitable for:** Developer tools, CLI utilities, smaller platforms, and any implementation that wants to establish the foundational guarantee.

### Standard Certification

**Specification coverage:** Levels 1-5 (Basic + Pre-Execution Defense, Audit & Integrity)

**What it proves:** Everything in Basic, plus:
- Action requests are inspected for injection attacks and exfiltration patterns before execution.
- Every action produces a tamper-evident, cryptographically chained audit record.
- Audit records can be independently verified for integrity.

**Suitable for:** SaaS platforms, fintech products, healthtech products, and any implementation serving customers with compliance requirements (SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS).

### Advanced Certification

**Specification coverage:** Levels 1-7 (Standard + Attack Detection & Response, Cross-Agent Trust & Federation)

**What it proves:** Everything in Standard, plus:
- The implementation detects anomalous agent behavior in real time.
- Automated responses (session revocation, credential rotation, alerting) are triggered on high-confidence attack signals.
- Cross-agent trust delegation is supported with scope attenuation and chain validation.
- The implementation supports federation with other NL-conforming platforms.

**Suitable for:** Enterprise platforms, cloud vendors, multi-agent orchestration systems, and implementations operating in high-security environments.

## 3. Certification Process

### Step 1: Self-Assessment

Run the NL Protocol conformance test suite against your implementation.

```bash
# Install the conformance test suite.
npm install -g @nl-protocol/conformance

# Run tests for your target level.
nl-conformance test --level basic --target https://your-platform.com/nl/
nl-conformance test --level standard --target https://your-platform.com/nl/
nl-conformance test --level advanced --target https://your-platform.com/nl/

# Generate a conformance report.
nl-conformance report --output conformance-report.json
```

The test suite validates each requirement at each level. It produces a structured report listing every test, its result (pass/fail/skip), and diagnostic details for failures.

Before submitting, ensure that all tests for your target level pass. The review will not proceed if the automated suite reports failures.

### Step 2: Submit Application

Submit your certification application via the NL Protocol certification portal (or via email during the pre-launch phase). Your application must include:

1. **Conformance report** generated by the automated test suite (`conformance-report.json`).
2. **Architecture document** (2-5 pages) describing:
   - How your implementation handles agent identity verification.
   - How secrets are resolved and injected without entering agent context.
   - How execution isolation is achieved (process isolation, containers, etc.).
   - (Standard) How pre-execution defense and audit integrity are implemented.
   - (Advanced) How attack detection and cross-agent trust are implemented.
3. **Point of contact** for the engineering team responsible for the implementation.
4. **Product/platform information**: Name, URL, description, and target audience.

### Step 3: Review

NL Protocol maintainers review your submission within 30 calendar days. The review includes:

- **Automated verification.** The review team re-runs the conformance test suite independently to confirm results.
- **Architecture review.** The team evaluates whether the implementation's design genuinely achieves the security properties required at the claimed level. Passing tests is necessary but not sufficient -- the architecture must also be sound.
- **Clarification requests.** The review team may ask follow-up questions about specific design decisions, edge cases, or failure modes. Expect 1-2 rounds of clarification.

The review is collaborative, not adversarial. The goal is to ensure that the certification is meaningful, not to gatekeep.

### Step 4: Certificate Issued

Upon successful review:

- You receive an official **NL Protocol Certification Certificate** specifying your conformance level, the date of certification, and the specification version tested against.
- You receive the **NL Protocol Certified badge** (in SVG and PNG formats) for use in your product, documentation, and marketing materials.
- Your implementation is **listed in the official NL Protocol Certified Directory**, a public registry of all certified products.
- The certificate is **valid for one year** from the date of issue.

---

## 4. Benefits of Certification

### Use the "NL Protocol Certified" Badge

Display the certification badge in your product documentation, marketing materials, and platform console. The badge communicates to your users that your implementation has been independently verified.

Badges are provided in three variants:

- **NL Protocol Certified -- Basic**
- **NL Protocol Certified -- Standard**
- **NL Protocol Certified -- Advanced**

Usage guidelines are provided with the badge assets. The badge must reference the correct level and must not be used if certification has expired.

### Listed in the Official Directory

The NL Protocol Certified Directory is the authoritative list of implementations that have passed certification. Users looking for NL-conforming tools, platforms, and SDKs will find your product here. The directory includes:

- Product name and description.
- Certification level.
- Date of certification and expiration.
- Link to your product.

### Customer Confidence

Certification gives your customers a simple, verifiable answer to the question: "Does this product actually keep secrets out of agent context?" Instead of evaluating your security architecture themselves, they can rely on the independent certification.

### Compliance Documentation

The certification report can be included in your compliance packages (SOC 2 audit evidence, ISO 27001 control documentation, vendor security assessments). It provides third-party attestation that your secret management practices meet NL Protocol standards.

---

## 5. Renewal

Certifications are valid for **one year**. Renewal ensures that implementations remain conformant as the specification evolves and as the implementation itself changes.

### Renewal Process

1. **Re-run the conformance test suite** against the current version of the specification. If the specification has been updated since your initial certification, new tests may apply.
2. **Submit the updated conformance report** along with a brief summary of any changes to your implementation since the previous certification.
3. **Expedited review.** Renewals undergo a shorter review process (target: 14 calendar days) focused on new or changed requirements.
4. **Updated certificate issued** with a new expiration date.

### What If the Specification Has Changed?

If a new specification version introduces requirements that your implementation does not yet satisfy, you have two options:

- **Implement the new requirements** and certify at your current level against the new specification version.
- **Maintain certification** at your current level against the previous specification version, with a notation that the certification references an older specification. The directory will indicate this.

Implementations are encouraged to track specification updates and implement new requirements promptly.

### Lapsed Certification

If certification expires without renewal:

- The product is removed from the Certified Directory.
- The badge must no longer be displayed.
- Re-certification follows the full initial process (Step 1-4), not the expedited renewal process.

## 6. For Agent Providers

Agent providers -- companies that build and operate AI agent frameworks (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Microsoft, and others) -- play a critical role in the NL Protocol ecosystem. When an agent framework natively supports NL Protocol, every developer using that framework benefits automatically.

### What Certification Means for Agent Providers

An agent framework certified at a given level guarantees that:

- The framework's agents are issued verifiable identity documents (L1).
- The framework routes secret access through NL-compatible action pipelines instead of reading secrets into context (L2).
- The framework executes secret-dependent actions in isolated environments (L3).
- (Standard) The framework inspects action requests for injection and logs actions with integrity (L4-L5).
- (Advanced) The framework detects attacks in real time and supports cross-agent trust delegation (L6-L7).

### How to Get Started

1. **Review the specification.** Understand the requirements for each level. See the [specification overview](../../specification/v1.0/00-overview.md).
2. **Identify the integration surface.** In most agent frameworks, the key integration point is the tool/function calling mechanism. Instead of allowing tools to return secret values into the context window, route secret access through an NL-compatible execution layer.
3. **Implement Level 1-3 first.** Basic conformance is the highest-impact, lowest-effort starting point.
4. **Run the conformance test suite** to validate your implementation.
5. **Submit for certification.**

### The Impact

When an agent provider certifies, every developer using that framework gains NL Protocol protection by default. This is the single highest-leverage action in the NL Protocol ecosystem. A single certification from a major agent provider protects millions of developers.

## 7. For Platform Providers

Platform providers -- companies that issue credentials consumed by AI agents (AWS, Stripe, GitHub, Twilio, databases, SaaS APIs) -- can certify their NL Protocol integration to assure customers that agent access to their platform is secure.

### What Certification Means for Platform Providers

A platform certified at a given level guarantees that:

- The platform authenticates agents via verifiable identity documents (L1).
- The platform accepts action requests instead of exposing raw credentials to agents (L2).
- The platform resolves credentials internally and returns only action results (L3).
- (Standard) The platform defends against injection attacks and provides audit trails (L4-L5).
- (Advanced) The platform detects anomalous agent behavior and supports federated trust (L6-L7).

### How to Get Started

1. **Review the Platform Guide.** See [PLATFORM-GUIDE.md](../adoption/PLATFORM-GUIDE.md) for detailed implementation guidance, including integration patterns and worked examples for Stripe and AWS.
2. **Define your action manifest.** List the operations that agents should be able to perform on your platform.
3. **Implement NL-compatible endpoints** that accept action requests and resolve credentials internally.
4. **Run the conformance test suite.**
5. **Submit for certification.**

### Integration Patterns

Platform providers typically integrate via one of three patterns:

- **MCP Server pattern**: For platforms that expose tools to AI agents via the Model Context Protocol.
- **REST API pattern**: For platforms that expose HTTP endpoints.
- **SDK pattern**: For client libraries that developers use in their applications.

See [PLATFORM-GUIDE.md](../adoption/PLATFORM-GUIDE.md) for detailed documentation on each pattern.

## 8. Pricing

### Open Source Implementations

**Free.** Certification for open-source implementations (licensed under an OSI-approved license) is provided at no cost. The NL Protocol is an open standard, and open-source implementations are essential to its adoption. The certification process is identical -- the only difference is the price. For example, the [Braincol Vault](https://github.com/braincol/braincol-vault) open-source core (Apache-2.0) qualifies for free certification.

### Commercial Implementations

Commercial pricing is available for proprietary implementations and products. Pricing is based on the certification level and the size of the organization.

| Level | Pricing |
|-------|---------|
| Basic | Contact for pricing |
| Standard | Contact for pricing |
| Advanced | Contact for pricing |

Contact **certification@nl-protocol.org** for commercial pricing and to begin the certification process.

Revenue from commercial certifications funds the ongoing maintenance of the conformance test suite, the certification infrastructure, and the NL Protocol specification itself.

### Renewals

- **Open source:** Free.
- **Commercial:** Renewal pricing is 50% of the initial certification fee.

## 9. Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does the certification process take?

From submission to certificate: 30 calendar days for initial certification, 14 calendar days for renewals. This assumes no major issues are found. If clarification rounds are needed, add 7-14 days per round.

### Can I certify a partial implementation?

You must fully satisfy all requirements at your target level. You cannot certify at "Standard minus L4" -- you either meet Standard or you certify at Basic. Certification levels are cumulative.

### What if I fail the conformance tests?

Fix the issues and resubmit. There is no penalty or waiting period for resubmission. The review team is happy to provide guidance on what needs to change.

### Can I certify an internal tool that is not publicly available?

Yes. Internal tools can be certified. The conformance test suite runs against your implementation directly. The directory listing can be marked as "internal" or omitted if you prefer not to be listed publicly.

### Is the conformance test suite open source?

Yes. The test suite is available in the `conformance/` directory of the NL Protocol repository, licensed under Apache 2.0. You can run it freely during development. Certification adds the independent verification and the official badge.

### What specification version is tested?

Certification always references a specific specification version (e.g., "NL Protocol v1.0"). When a new specification version is released, existing certifications remain valid until their expiration date. Renewals are tested against the latest specification version.

### Who are the reviewers?

NL Protocol maintainers and designated reviewers. Reviewers must not have a conflict of interest with the applicant. The review roster is published in the governance documentation.

### How do I report a certified product that no longer conforms?

Open an issue in the NL Protocol repository or email **certification@nl-protocol.org**. The review team will investigate and may require the product to re-certify.
